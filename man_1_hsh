- command interpreter
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B hsh$	[-/+abCEefhIimnPpTuVvx]	[-/+o longname]	[script	[arg ...]]
.SH DESCRIPTION
Simple shell is a command-line interpreter that provides a command line user interface for Unix-like operating systems.

That is, commands can be typed directly to the running shell or can be put into a file, which can be executed directly by the shell.

.B Search and Execution

There are three types of commands:shell functions, built-in commands, and normalprograms. 

The command is searched for (by name) in that order. The three types of commands are all executedin a different way.
Path Search When locating a command, the shell first looks to see if it has a shell function by that name.  Then it looks for a built-in command by that name. If a built-in command is not found, one of two things happen:

1. Command names containing a slash are simply executed without per forming any searches.

2. The shell searches each entry in the PATH variable in turn for thecommand. The value of the PATH variable should be a series of entries separated by colons. Each entry consists of a directory name. 
The current directory may be indicated implicitly by an empty directory name, or explicitly by a single period.

.B Built-in commands

This section lists the built-in commands.
